# To access your partner's functions, use data.<functionname>()
# Ask your partner what their functions are called and what they do

Goals of this file:     
Interact with user
Ask if they'd like to read or to write
If read, display all titles and allow to select one (Access functions from data.py)
When selected, display title and full text to user

If write, receive user input for title and text and use data.py functions to write to .txt

Good luck!
