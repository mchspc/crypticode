'''
You are in charge of interacting with the user via the command line
You can access your partner's functions by writing data.function()

Refer to this cheat-sheet for help!
https://github.com/mchspc/crypticode/blob/main/main-cheat.md

Goals
-----
- Interact with user
- Ask if they'd like to read or to write
- If read, display all titles and allow to select one (Access functions from data.py)
    - To get the 2 lists from the read function, use: titles, content = data.read_file() to get a list of titles and a list of content (assuming your partner's code worked)
    - When selected, display title and full text to user
- If write, ask for the title and content, and pass as arguments through the write function from data.py

Good luck!
